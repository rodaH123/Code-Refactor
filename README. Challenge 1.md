#Refactoring of Marketing website to improve accessability



Code was improved by adding company name of "Horiseon" in place of the word "title" in the heading section of the webpage.  This will help to distinguish this webpage from other webpages.

Changed the div tag to Nav in the header section to correctly reference the navigation section of the website.

After the div tag was changed to Nav tag in the HTML code, I updated the header selector in CSS style to change Div tag to Nav for three of the headers. This helped to lign up the three Navigation panels on the right hand side of the webpage as opposed to the left hand side of the page.

Added Semantic elements such as Header,Section, Main and Aside in place of Div in the appropriate places in sequential order

Alt attributes were added next to images describing the images to improve accesability. Alt attributes were added for all images listed on the website explaining the images in details.  Alt attributes were added next to the corresponding images.



The improvements of semantic elements coupled with the addition of alt attributes will optimize search engines. 



Deployed HTML URL after refactoring of Marketing website with approriate HTLM semeantic elements and the addition of alt attributes for all included images on the Marketing website to improve accessability.
