#Refactoring of Marketing website to improve accessability



Code was improved by adding company name of "Horiseon" in place of the word "title" in the heading section of the webpage.  This will help to distinguish this webpage from other webpages.

Changed the div tag to Nav in the header section to correctly reference the navigation section of the website.

Added Semantic elements such as Header,Section, Main and Aside in place of Div in the appropriate places in sequential order

Alt attributes were added next to images describing the images to improve accesability. Alt attributes were added for all images listed on the website explaining the images in details.



The improvements of semantic elements coupled with the addition of alt attributes will optimize search engines.
