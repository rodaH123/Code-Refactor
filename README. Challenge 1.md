#Refactoring of Marketing website to improve accessability

Code was improved by adding name of title to a previous HMTL that did not include company name. This will help to distinguish webpage from others.
Changed the div tag to Nav for the tags that were referencing the navigation section of the webiste
Semantic html's such as Header,Section, Main and Aside were added in place of Div in sequential order
Alt attributes were added next to images describing the images to improve accesability. Alt attributes were added for all images listed on the website explaining the images in details.
The improvements of semantic elements coupled with the addition of alt attributes will optimize search engines.
